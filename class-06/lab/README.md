# Lab 06: Start the Salmon Cookies project

In class, we learned how to model an entity in JavaScript using objects. Now, it's your turn to start building an application that models the problem domain in the support doc linked in *Helpful Resources*.

You will also simultaneously be working with more specific style and design concepts with this assignment over the next few labs.

## Setup and Documentation

**Refer to the `assets` directory in the class repository for more information you need to get started on this project.**

Before writing a single line of code, be sure that you have a new repository (with a README!) called cookie-stand, and do your work in that directory. Each day you'll be working in separate branches. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Branch names can be whatever you want; it is suggested that you use some sort of standard organization such as `day-feature` for the branch name, such as `tue-models`. **Remember that there is a guide to setting up repos for this course in the Day 2 directory.***

Refer to the "Setting up a new project" document in the Class 2 directory of the class repository to do the intital file/directory configuration of this project.

## User Stories and Feature Tasks

### User Stories (MVP)
 - As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
 - As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
 - As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

### Technical Requirements
 - New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - Good use of Object Literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page

### Stretch Goals

*Read [this article](https://steadfastcreative.com/low-fidelity-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/){:target="_blank"}, [this article](https://mentormate.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/){:target="_blank"}, and [this article](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/low-fidelity-vs-high-fidelity-wireframing-is-paper-dead/){:target="_blank"} on the differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes. Based on these readings, draw conclusions about what you would want in your own low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes.*

 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business by generating a low-fidelity wireframe of what I want the page to look like.
- As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business by generating a high-fidelity wireframe of what I want the page to look like.

## Getting Started

- You are making five object literals in your JavaScript today. Consider what would be an efficient process for building those out.
- You have starting data, and a goal of end data that includes both arrays and single values. Think about what arrays you might need and also how you will use object methods to do your calculations. Keep in mind the single responsibility principle: a function/method should do only one thing.
